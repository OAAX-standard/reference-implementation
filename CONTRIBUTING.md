## How to contribute

The OAAX reference implementation is built to be straightforward to understand, build, and use. If you'd like to suggest improvements to the documentation or implementation, report a bug, or contribute a new feature, please follow these steps:
1. **Open an issue** in the repository to discuss your idea or improvement.
2. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear message.
4. **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
5. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository for review.


## Development environment

The OAAX reference implementation has been tested for building on x86_64 architecture machines running Ubuntu 20.04 or later.

### Runtime

The runtime library is built using CMake and several other dependencies. You can easily install them on a host machine by running this command (assuming you have cloned the repository):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup-env.sh
```

### Conversion toolchain

The conversion toolchain is built using Docker and requires Docker to be installed on your machine. You can find instructions for installing Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
